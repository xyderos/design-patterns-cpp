## Purpose

Construct objects step by step

## Reasoning

Extract the constructing code into builders by creating different steps eg chassis, engine and firmware as mentioned in the code examples

## When to use

* Assume you have an object that could potentially take 10 different optional parameters, it's easier to builder smaller versions or "parts" of it!

* When you want to create different variations of the type that is supposed to be represented
